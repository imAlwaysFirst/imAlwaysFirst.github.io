        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p class="Goals">My goals are to make sure that I can learn the most from the field that I am studying in and I believe that anyone can learn something new everyday, even when they believe that they are done with school.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <p class="Skills/Interests">My skills are that I am very good at handling pets and making sure that they have a fun experience at my Haven! I love coding and believe that this page explains everything as to why I love animals!</p>
      
        <h2>Interests</h2>

        <p class="Interests">My interests are in coding and being able to be around animals because I find it fun to be around any type of animal which is why I decided to create this Haven of mine! Coding is a way for me to relieve myself when I have a stressful day. Another interest of mine is playing a video game called League of Legends, this video game is really fun because it allows me to de-stress myself</p>

        <h1 id="transform">Welcome to my Homepage!</h1>

        <p id="text-output">The reason for my Haven is that I have always been in love with animals and I've always loved being around animals because I find them cute and they help boost moral.</p>
